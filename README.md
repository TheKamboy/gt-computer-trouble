> Keegan and his brother, Kameron, were playing a game, when they were called to fix a issue with the server room.
> They fought over who fixes it and accidentally breaks the terminal in the server room.

# Getting Started


## Requirements


### Linux or Mac (untested)

If your Linux Distro supports [Gum](#gum), then you are good.

Mac is untested but I think it might work since this game is just an sh script.


### Gum

Gum is a CLI for *glamorous shell scripts*. I use it for this game because it has a more appealing UI, and it makes game development quicker.

## Installation

> ðŸ”¨ There are no releases yet so links leading to releases may not have anything in them.

It is recommended to [install the latest version of the game](https://github.com/TheKamboy/gt-computer-trouble/releases/latest).

Unpack the .zip (or .tar.gz depending on what you installed)


## How to set up the download for playing

-   Set `gtct.sh` to be executable and run it like a program in the terminal `./gtct.sh`.

or

-   Run it in the terminal like this `sh ./gtct.sh`.


## Other Ways to Play

> ðŸ’£ The Replit version isn't very buggy, but it's still recommended to play with other options instead.

# New Name

Keegan's Game has now been renamed to Ghost Team, due to request from my brother.

# Getting Started


## Requirements


### Linux

I don&rsquo;t have a Mac but you might be fine if you play using a Mac.

1.  Linux in Windows

    You can use **wsl** to run a Linux Virtual Machine in Windows.
    
    [Here&rsquo;s Microsoft&rsquo;s guide to setting it up.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)


## Installation

> ðŸ”¨ There are no releases yet so links leading to releases may not have anything in them.

It is recommended to [install the latest version of the game](https://github.com/TheKamboy/gt-computer-trouble/releases/latest).

Unpack the .zip (or .tar.gz depending on what you installed)


# New Name

Keegan&rsquo;s Game has now been renamed to Ghost Team, due to request from my brother.

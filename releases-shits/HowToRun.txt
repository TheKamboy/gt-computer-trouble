If you are on Windows, you will need WSL.
I'm too lazy to explain shit, so search it up.

You will need Gum to run this, and I'm not doing fancy stuff
to put it in /tmp, so do install it yourself.
I will do that when I add it.
Here's link: https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum

Make sure all the scripts are executable in the folder.
If you want to just run this IN THE FOLDER: chmod +x *

If not just "chmod +x" these files:
gtct-demo.sh
pausefunction
randomoldman

Now, just run "gtct-demo" with this command: "./gtct-demo.sh"

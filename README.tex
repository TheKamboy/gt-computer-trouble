\begin{quote}
Keegan and his brother, Kameron, were playing a game, when they were called to fix a issue with the server room.
They fought over who fixes it and accidentally breaks the terminal in the server room.
A portal emerges and sucks them both in.

Will they make it out? Play and find out.

\section{Getting Started}
\label{sec:org59d15f0}
\subsection{Requirements}
\label{sec:org22a3ab2}
\subsubsection{Linux or Mac (untested)}
\label{sec:orgf8d6a19}
If your Linux Distro supports \hyperref[sec:org467268d]{Gum}, then you are good.

Mac is untested but I think it might work since this game is just an sh script.
\subsubsection{Gum}
\label{sec:org467268d}
Gum is a CLI for \emph{glamorous shell scripts}. I use it for this game because it has a more appealing UI, and it makes game development quicker.

\subsection{Installation}
\label{sec:orgeaaf80e}
\begin{quote}
ðŸ”¨ There are no releases yet so links leading to releases may not have anything in them.
\end{quote}
It is recommended to \href{https://github.com/TheKamboy/gt-computer-trouble/releases/latest}{install the latest version of the game}.

Unpack the .zip (or .tar.gz depending on what you installed)
\subsection{How to set up the download for playing}
\label{sec:orgb2552db}
\begin{itemize}
\item Set \texttt{gtct.sh} to be executable and run it like a program in the terminal \texttt{./gtct.sh}.
\end{itemize}

or

\begin{itemize}
\item Run it in the terminal like this \texttt{sh ./gtct.sh}.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Other Ways to Play}
\label{sec:org0d2cc0e}
\begin{quote}
ðŸ’£ The Replit version is VERY buggy, so it's recommended to play with the other options instead.
\end{quote}
\href{https://replit.com/@Kamboy123/gt-computer-trouble?v=1}{You can play on Replit!}
\section{New Name}
\label{sec:org77f73e2}
Keegan's Game has now been renamed to Ghost Team, due to request from my brother.

One day, at Fort Bradley, Keegan and Kameron were fighting each other in a game of Super Slap Dudes.

Keegan: You are finished!
Kameron: Nuh uh!

(Kameron activates a button combo, and slaps Keegan out of the map)

TV: GAME! Kameron wins!
Keegan: FUCK!
Kameron: Haha.

(A soldier walks in)
Soldier: Kameron and Keegan, you are needed in the server room!
Kameron: Ugh, alright Keeg, let's go.
Keegan: Alright.

(They go through the elevator and enter the server room)
Kameron: What seems to be the problem?
Engineer: The servers have been acting funky. Can you hop on the terminal over there and reboot the systems?
Kameron: I thought I told you guys how to do that.
Engineer: Well, it didn’t work.
Kameron: Alright. Let me handle this.
Keegan: No, I can handle it.
Kameron: Keegan, I’m the tech guy, I can do this.
Keegan: No Kameron, I can do it! I know things about computers.
Kameron: NO!
(Keegan and Kameron start fighting each other about who fixes the servers.)
Engineer: You guys shouldn’t be fighting in a room full of expensive hardware!
(Keegan shoves Kameron into the terminal breaking it a bit)
(Loud noises start erupting from it)
Kameron: Ow, shit! What did you do?!
(The terminal starts shaking the room, then makes a portal that start vacuuming up the room)
(Kameron gets sucked in)
Keegan: Oh shit!
(Keegan gets sucked in)
Keegan: Ahhhhhhhhh!
Objective 1: Find Kameron
(Keegan wakes up, in a weird world full of numbers, symbols, and other things.)
Keegan: Ughhh…Where am I? Kameron? You here?
(...no response)
Keegan: Dammit, I gotta find him.

Keegan and his brother, Kameron, were playing a game, when they were called to fix a issue with the server room.
They fought over who fixes it and accidentally breaks the terminal in the server room.
A portal emerges and sucks them both in.

Will they make it out? Play and find out.

* Getting Started
** Requirements
*** Linux or Mac (untested)
If your Linux Distro supports [[id:c86374a4-c73c-46c0-a53e-95465328c6b9][Gum]], then you are good.

Mac is untested but I think it might work since this game is just an sh script.
*** Gum
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:        c86374a4-c73c-46c0-a53e-95465328c6b9
:END:
Gum is a CLI for /glamorous shell scripts/. I use it for this game because it has a more appealing UI, and it makes game development quicker.

** Installation
#+begin_quote
⚠️ There are no releases yet so links leading to releases may not have anything in them.
#+end_quote
It is recommended to [[https://github.com/TheKamboy/gt-computer-trouble/releases/latest][install the latest version of the game]].

Unpack the .zip (or .tar.gz depending on what you installed)

Now you have two options.

1. Set ~gtct.sh~ to be executable and run it like a program in the terminal ~./gtct.sh~.
1. Run it in the terminal like this ~sh ./gtct.sh~.

* New Name
Keegan's Game has now been renamed to Ghost Team, due to request from my brother.

# Welcome

This is a walkthrough I made just in case you don't know what to do.

You could also just look at the source code,
but this is here so that you don't have to look through
my bad code to figure out what to do.

# Objective 1

> You wake up in a weird world, a matrix looking world.
> You must find where your brother went.

## The Camp Site

The camp site just has a **can of beans** there. You should take that for later.

## The Shack

There is an **old man** there. He begs for some money.
It's your choice to give him money or not.

## The Town Entrance

There is a town, but a guard won't let you enter because your brother tried to
get into it and got captured. Maybe there is another way in...

## How to Enter the Town

Go to the shack and talk to the old man. Once that's done, examine the shack
to take the ladder.

Now, go to the town entrance and open your inventory.
Select the ladder to place it on the tree.
Examine the tree to enter it, then jump out the tree to enter the town.
